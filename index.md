# Collaborating and sharing using GitHub without command line

In this tutorial we will start out with a super brief introduction to Git and
GitHub and exercise useful workflows within GitHub.

We will avoid using the command line and instead practice Collaborating and
sharing using graphical interfaces (web interface or GitHub Desktop).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> ### Please prepare these before the workshop
>
> - Install the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) ([our tips](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/])
> - Get a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
> - Install GitHub Desktop:
>   - [Windows and macOS](https://desktop.github.com/)
>   - [Linux](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/blob/linux/README.md)
>
>
> ### Troubleshooting
>
>   - GitHub Desktop not showing up on macOS launchpad:
>     - You can find it in "Downloads"
>
>
> ### Not required
>
> - Previous knowledge of Git or GitHub
> - Knowledge of the command line
>
>
> ### Optional reading
>
> - [Quickly get started with common tasks on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart)
>
>
> ### Why [GitHub](https://github.com)?
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
>
> We also encourage course participants to use our new [Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org),
> for more information see [https://coderefinery.org/repository/](https://coderefinery.org/repository/).
