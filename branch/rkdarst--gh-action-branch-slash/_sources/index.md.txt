# Collaborating and sharing using GitHub without command line

This tutorial provides a brief but usable introduction to Git and
GitHub and exercise useful workflows within GitHub.  Git is a version
control system which allows files and data to be synchronized, an
Github is a popular website that stores these repositories.

It avoids using the command line and instead practice collaborating and
sharing using either the Github website or GitHub desktop
application.  Why?  Because for many cases, it is enough.  Especially
if you are contributing to existing non-code projects, this may be the
fastest, easiest way to do it.  Git and Github provide collaboration
tools to all kinds of projects, and there are all kinds of good ways
to use it.

This serves as an introduction to git.  After this lesson, you will
both be able to use git, and feel much more confident taking a
command-line course git course such as
[CodeRefinery's git-intro
course](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).  Check out our
[other upcoming workshops](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/).

> ## Why [GitHub](https://github.com)?
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
>
> We also encourage course participants to use our new [Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org),
> for more information see [https://coderefinery.org/repository/](https://coderefinery.org/repository/).
