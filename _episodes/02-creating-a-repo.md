## Exercise: create a repository and track changes

We will create a repository to track our favourite recipe on GitHub. Work in
pairs on your computers. Instructor does this on the main screen. In this
exercise we will not do any merges yet.

We wish to arrive at something like this (but no problem to have more
branches):

- Create a repository on GitHub
- Commit changes
- Create a new branch
- Commit changes to a branch
- Switch between branches
- Browse the branches network on GitHub
- Show how to remove a repository again

**TODO**: add more text, context, and screenshots
