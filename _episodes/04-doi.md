## Making your project citable

There are many services where you can share or archive your code and data:
See for instance our
[lesson on reproducible research](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/03-sharing/#services-for-sharing-and-collaborating-on-research-data).

In this present lesson we will discuss one of the many options to get a **digital object identifier (DOI)**
for your dataset or code:
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), A general-purpose open access repository
created by [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) and CERN.
**Integration with GitHub**, allows researchers to upload files up to 50 GB.

> ## We will exercise in the Zenodo sandbox
>
> We will practice on [https://sandbox.zenodo.org/](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/)
> and not on the "real" [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)
> to make sure we do not create "real" DOIs which we cannot remove.
>
> The sandbox service is useful to calibrate your setup until you are happy with the result
> and then you can go for the real service. Once a dataset is uploaded to the "real" service,
> it cannot be easily removed or modified again (and this is good, otherwise DOIs would not make much sense).

### Step 1: Prepare an example repository

Through web:
- Create a new repository on GitHub
- Upload some example data into it

Or using GitHub Desktop:
- Create a new repository
- Commit some example data
- Publish your example repository to GitHub

### Step 2: Activate the repository on Zenodo (sandbox)

> ## We will exercise in the Zenodo sandbox

> We will practice on [https://sandbox.zenodo.org/](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/)
> and not on the "real" [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)
> to make sure we do not create "real" DOIs which we cannot remove.
