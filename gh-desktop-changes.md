# Making changes with GitHub Desktop

**Scenario**: You've created a repository through the web interface, but now you have multiple files that you would like to add. *Do you see an easy way to do this in the web interface?*

## Step 1: Open GitHub Desktop and Sign In

On Windows, go to File > Options. On Mac, go to GitHub Desktop > Preferences.

On the Accounts tab, click the Sign In button to sign in with your GitHub credentials in the browser.

Even though the friendly welcome screen has a big button to clone a repository, that welcome screen won't always be there. The more consistent way to do this is to click on File > Clone repository.

```

In the Github.com tab, all of your repositories will be listed. Scroll until you find the recipes repository you created in the previous lesson.

Now choose a folder on your computer where it makes sense to save those files. The default is probably fine, but remember where it is.

Click Clone to download the files ... and all of the associated history to your computer.

## Step 2: Add new files to the cloned directory

## Step 3: Make a conflicting change
